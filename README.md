## Description

**RecStreams** can record several streams at once from multiple websites. You can check which sites are supported here: https://recstreams.com/Supported/

There are two options for recording:

**Download Streams:** It checks if the stream is online. If it is, the stream will be recorded until it ends or is interrupted.

**Monitor Streams:** Works like the download option but will periodically check if the stream is online instead of only once. This means all future videos from that stream will be automatically recorded.

**Extra:** RecStreams can also download videos (e.g., YouTube videos) from the supported sites.
